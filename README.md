Local Development / Docker Compose: Dockerfiles are included for integration with the frontend and backend.

---

## 🐳 Docker Usage
### Development
Intended for local development with the **monorepo (`codeuniverse`)**, where the `ai_assistant` folder is part of the overall project structure.  
In this case, the `WORKDIR` is `/app/ai_assistant` and the application runs on port **8000**:

```bash
docker build -f dockerfile.dev -t ai-assistant-dev .
docker run -p 8000:8000 ai-assistant-dev

`````

### Production
Intended for deployment on Hugging Face Spaces or when cloning only the standalone repository codeuniverse-demo-ai_assistant.
Here, the WORKDIR is /app and the application runs on port 7860 (required by HF Spaces):

```bash
docker build -f dockerfile.prod -t ai-assistant-prod .
docker run -p 7860:7860 ai-assistant-prod
`````

ℹ️ **Note:**  
- Use the *Development* configuration if you are working locally with the full monorepo.
- Use the *Production* configuration if you are working with the isolated ai_assistant repo or deploying to Hugging Face Spaces.
